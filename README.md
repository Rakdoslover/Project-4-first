The problem terminal indicates that some of my lines are to long, 2 in the env.py and 5 in the settings.py:

env.py: The lines are my DATABASE_URL key/value pair and my CLOUDINARY_URL key/value pair
I won't change this because of safety reasons while deploying.

settings.py: The lines are the password authentication provided by django while installing.
